                        <strong>Monoidal Rows</strong> is an experimental type system based on <a href="./resources.html">various works</a>,
                        most notably <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290325">Abstracting Extensible Data Types or Rows By Any Other Name</a>.

                    <p>
                        The initial row implementation was a fairly exact replica of the row theory termed "simple rows" in that paper.
                        I have since extended it with a number of features of varying ambition and theoretical soundness.

                    <p>
                        There is no parser or driver here. The expected usage is as a
                        reference, but if you would like to play with the
                        inference there is a convenient test function in
                        <code>Main</code> for use in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">GHCi</a>.

                    <p>
                        The code and concepts explored here are public domain, do whatever you
                        like with them. I'd like to hear from you if it turns
                        out to be useful to you in a project or
                        self-education.

                    <h2 id="section-features"><a class="anchor" href="#section-features">üîó</a>Features</h2>
                    <h3 id="section-monoidal-rows"><a class="anchor" href="#section-monoidal-rows">üîó</a>Monoidal rows</h3>
                    <p>
                        The basic concept here is the inclusion of the row
                        concatenation constraint <code class="equation">Œ∂‚ÇÅ ‚äô Œ∂‚ÇÇ ~ Œ∂‚ÇÉ</code> which is the only
                        way to combine rows in this system, and stands in
                        contrast to other systems where in the usual method f
                        row combination is via extension.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ie, rather than type constructors like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">data Type
    = ...
    | TRowExtend Field Type
    | TRowNil</code></pre>
                    <p>You have only a type constructor like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">data Type
    = ...
    | TRow (Map Name Type)</code></pre>
                    <p>and combination is done via constraint solving.</p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, there is a constraint for row
                        subtyping <code class="equation">Œ∂‚ÇÅ ‚óÅ Œ∂‚ÇÇ</code>, which allows constraining a row
                        to a subset of another. This is representable in
                        terms of the concatenation constraint, and in other
                        implementations based on this paper it is; however I
                        have found it allows a nice syntactic simplification
                        of many constraints and so I have chosen to leave it
                        as its own constraint constructor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the <code class="equation">‚äô</code> operation being associative and
                        commutative, the rows are still only partial monoids,
                        as the union produced is expected to be disjoint.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="section-pattern-matching-inference"><a class="anchor" href="#section-pattern-matching-inference">üîó</a>Pattern matching inference</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first extension made to the implementation in
                        comparison to that of the original paper was to
                        replace the branch operation <code class="equation">Œî</code> with a pattern
                        matching implementation. This is a very
                        straight-forward addition, and the features I have
                        gone with here could easily be extended further; for
                        example I have product row patterns as always
                        producing a sub-row constraint, but other types of
                        patterns would easily extend this, such as making
                        the current system accessible via an additive <code class="equation">...</code>
                        pattern, and expecting patterns without this
                        qualifier to emit an exact constraint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This just required extending the AST with a <code>Patt</code>
                        type and mirroring the infer and check functions as
                        <code>inferPatt</code> and <code>checkPatt</code>
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="section-effect-rows"><a class="anchor" href="#section-effect-rows">üîó</a>Effect rows</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most theoretically sketchy addition I have made
                        here is to distinguish between the existing rows
                        (re-termed data row) and effects rows, with the
                        effect rows being simple lists of types rather than
                        maps. The sketchy part being that I allow
                        instantiation of effect constructors at multiple
                        different parameters in the same row. This leads to
                        a rather complicated constraint reduction/unification strategy,
                        and the consequences of my implementation have not been fully explored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notably, because effect constructors can be
                        instantiated at multiple types, we cannot always
                        unify variables immediately. I have chosen to unify
                        where there is only one option and to emit a sub-row
                        constraint where there are multiple. One can imagine
                        this may lead to unsoundness in some scenario,
                        though my testing has not revealed any such problems
                        yet. A simple fix for this, if it proves to be
                        problematic, would simply be to not unify the free
                        meta-variables inside effect rows at all, and to
                        expect other uses of the variable to provide the
                        unification for us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Various things were added to the implementation to
                        support the effect rows, including a handler term,
                        evidence passing during inference, and an extension
                        to the environment containing effect definitions.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="section-data-constraints"><a class="anchor" href="#section-data-constraints">üîó</a>Data constraints</h3>
                    <p>
                        This simple extension adds a new member to the
                        environment containing <code class="equation">œÑ ‚Üí œÅ</code>
                        data type associations, and two new constraints allowing the
                        binding of a type to be a data type of either
                        product or row construction. <code>TProd</code> and <code>TSum</code> type
                        constructors become ephemeral constraint-passing
                        markers for use with <code>check</code>, and instead of inferring
                        all uses of rows as instantiations of <code>TProd</code> or <code>TRow</code>,
                        we infer them to be instantiations of variable type
                        constrained to an appropriate row association.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inclusion of this feature is designed to counter
                        the usual problems of structural typing; ie
                        incompatibility with systems like typeclasses, and
                        the need for complex methods to work with recursive
                        aliases. This allows us to have our row
                        polymorphism, with the same level of expressivity,
                        while maintaining nominative type system features as
                        well. This has no impact on theoretic soundness, but
                        does lead to more verbose signatures. This could be
                        combatted by the addition of inline constraints like
                        those used in the original paper, which would
                        presumably be lifted into the current qualifier
                        system at kind inference.

                    <h3 id="section-layout-polymorphism"><a class="anchor" href="#section-layout-polymorphism">üîó</a>Layout polymorphism</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is another large addition, but turned out not
                        to have nearly the same sketchy theoretical
                        implications as the effect rows, though the method
                        of solve is quite similar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Essentially, I borrow and extend concepts from
                        implementations of first-class labels
                        (√† la <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fclabels.pdf">First Class Labels for Extensible Rows</a>)
                        in order to allow a new kind of polymorphic variance over data.
                        In data rows, instead of a map from strings to types,
                        we now have an associative array of labels to types,
                        where labels are themselves a pair of types. The
                        types contained in this pair are expected to always
                        be of the kinds <code class="equation">Int</code> and
                        <code class="equation">String</code> respectively;
                        in other words we lift integers and strings to the type
                        level to serve together as our label. The string
                        obviously serves the same purpose as before, while
                        the addition of the integer allows us to talk about
                        the layout of our data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike in systems with true first-class labels, I do
                        not allow full polymorphic variance over the entire
                        label of a given field. Instead, either the layout
                        or the name must always be specified. This
                        limitation simplifies the constraint solving to a
                        great degree and allows it to be easily shown as
                        sound, avoiding the problem encountered in effects
                        rows. Multiple possible unifications of labels are
                        invariably an error.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To support this feature I added new forms to the AST
                        in terms and pattern matching, that each allow
                        either variance over layout or naming of their
                        specified structures. This is fairly straight
                        forward, and just leads to a bit of code repetition
                        as we decide between creation of fresh meta
                        variables for either the layout or name in labels.
                        As it is quite verbose, I have left the syntax
                        extension quite simple, but a much more expressive
                        syntax should only require an equally straight
                        forward modification; one could imagine for example
                        allowing variance over some fields but not others
                        with optional syntax.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea with this feature was to circumvent another
                        typical problem with row types, that being that
                        layout is generally chosen by the compiler, making
                        it somewhat incompatible with usage in systems-level
                        languages. The concept here is that, when defining a
                        data type, the layout is always that given by the
                        programmer, and when utilizing the data type at term
                        (and pattern) level, the layout can be ignored. The
                        simple addition of allowing the programmer to talk
                        about the layout at term level also leads to
                        syntactic conveniences, such as (in the case of
                        un-curried functions using tuples for their n-ary
                        argument passing) allowing a simple implementation
                        of positional and named argument syntax. It also
                        allows dual-construction syntax like that of Haskell
                        data types. I also extended the usage of rows this
                        way for sums, which at a term/pattern level may have
                        limited use; however, being able to define the
                        discriminator in data type definitions is obviously
                        of some utility, if a language gives access to the
                        underlying structure of sums.
